# Preparing Chicago Crime Data

## Inspecting Chicago Crimes from 2001-2023

Author: Echo Diaz

My goal of this analysis is to help law enforcement to understand the various crimes that play crucial roles in Chicago's communities. The target is to highlight the patterns in crime over two decades, which districts have the most activity. My process is to target the year and month to find any seasonality. I ask and answer pointed questions to get an overall makeup of Chicago crimes. Law Enforcement can use this analysis to send extra or specialized mental health counselors to aid in officiers collecting evidence and provide guidance.

While crime in Chicago has a negative skew, trending in a decline in crime, there is plenty to gleen from this data.

### The total number of crimes is decreasing across the years, seemlingly dropping 30% every decade.

### **Are there any individual crimes that are doing the opposite (e.g decreasing when overall crime is increasing or vice-versa)?**

Crimes Increasing:

    * Criminal Sexual Assault
    * Homicide 
    * Stalking
    * Motor Vehicle Theft
    * Weapons Violation
    * Human Trafficking


#### Sexual Assault by Year
Sexual assults are on the rise, dipping in 2020 due to the COVID epidemic and mimicing 2005 with 1,550 sexual assults in 2022 alone.

#### Homicide by Year
From 2004 - 2015, crime was relatively low, staying around 450-525 homcides per year. However, that changed in 2016 in which crime skyrocketed to around 800 homicides. Crime remains high since then, sitting at 725 homicides in 2022.

#### Stalking by Year
Stalking was relatively low until 2021. Its possible this could be the effects from the COVID pandemic.  Stalking cases have more than doubled to 450 cases in 2022.

#### Human Trafficking by Year
Human Trafficking dipped in 2020 and 2021, no doubt due to the COVID pandemic. But, Chicago had its highest number in 2022 with 16 cases of human trafficking.

# Recommendations:

Utilize this data analysis to identify trends and allocate resources more effectively to prevent violent crime. Invest in quality education and job training programs, particularly in underserved communities, to provide people with better economic opportunities and reduce the motivations for criminal activity.

Enforce strict gun control measures, including background checks, waiting periods, and restrictions on high-capacity magazines and assault weapons. Reducing access to firearms can significantly impact the rate of gun-related homicides.

Train law enforcement officers to handle sexual assault cases sensitively and professionally. Establish specialized units for investigating sexual assault cases and prioritize victim-centered approaches. Advocate for and enforce strong laws against sexual assault. Remove legal barriers that can deter survivors from reporting, such as statutes of limitations.

Use data analysis to identify trends and hotspots for vehicle theft, allowing law enforcement to allocate resources more effectively. Create or support specialized law enforcement units focused on auto theft prevention and investigation. Increase police presence in areas with higher rates of vehicle theft to deter potential thieves and respond more quickly to incidents.Educate the public about the importance of vehicle security. Encourage residents to lock their cars, take their keys, and hide valuables to reduce opportunities for theft. 

Establish hotlines and reporting mechanisms where individuals can safely report suspected cases of human trafficking. Ensure that reports are handled discreetly and that whistleblowers are protected. Target the demand for commercial sex acts and forced labor by implementing policies and programs that deter potential buyers and employers. This may involve legal measures and awareness campaigns. Invest in research and data collection to better understand the patterns and trends of human trafficking in the city. Use this information to tailor prevention and intervention efforts.
