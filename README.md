# Preparing Chicago Crime Data

## Inspecting Chicago Crimes from 2001-2023

Author: Echo Diaz

My goal with this analysis is to assist law enforcement in understanding the various crimes that play crucial roles in Chicago's communities. The analysis highlights crime patterns over two decades and identifies districts with the most activity. Law enforcement can leverage this analysis to allocate resources effectively and provide specialized support where needed.

While crime in Chicago has a negative skew, trending in a decline, there is valuable information to glean from this data.

### The total number of crimes is decreasing across the years, seemlingly dropping 30% every decade.

### **Are there any individual crimes that are doing the opposite (e.g decreasing when overall crime is increasing or vice-versa)?**

Crimes Increasing:

    * Criminal Sexual Assault
    * Homicide 
    * Stalking
    * Motor Vehicle Theft
    * Weapons Violation
    * Human Trafficking


#### Criminal Sexual Assault by Year
Sexual assults are on the rise, dipping in 2020 due to the COVID epidemic and mimicing 2005 with 1,550 sexual assults in 2022 alone.
