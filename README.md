## Inspecting Chicago Crimes from 2001-2023

Author: Echo Diaz

My goal of this analysis is to help law enforcement to understand the various crimes that play crucial roles in Chicago's communities. The target is to highlight the patterns in crime over two decades, which districts have the most activity. My process is to target the year and month to find any seasonality. I ask and answer pointed questions to get an overall makeup of Chicago crimes. Law Enforcement can use this analysis to send extra or specialized mental health counselors to aid in officiers collecting evidence and provide guidance.
